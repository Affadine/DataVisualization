# Data Viz M2 IA (2020)


In this project, we wanted to show the consequences of climate change on the evolution of the biodiversity. As many species of trees and plates depends on the polenization of bees, 
we choosed to study the European bumble bees (different bee species of the genus Bombus) because a sain ecosystem will have a large population of bees.

we focused on four different visualisations:
 * desc 1
 * desc 2
 * desc 3
 * desc 4

Data:

The data that we represent come from the research site atlashymenoptera.net and consist of 79 different species of hymenoptera which evolved on the European continent between 1800 and 2013. Thanks to the 79 files collected, we were able to collect and collate data from all species and we have represented them on different charts and maps.


Contents:
On this project, we set up four visualizations, showing the geographical distribution of the data, the evolution over time and also a study by country on the proliferation of different bee species.
